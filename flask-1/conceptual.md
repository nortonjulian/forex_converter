- What is the role of web application framework, like Flask?
  Flask provides the tools and libraries upon which you can build an application
  in Python

- You can pass information to Flask either as a parameter in a route URL
  (like '/foods/pretzel') or using a URL query param (like
  'foods?type=pretzel'). How might you choose which one is a better fit
  for an application?
  The first one uses a form in "request.form" where a form is set up in a template
  while the second uses the query string in "request.args". It depends on what type
  of application. If it's just searching for something in a database the "request.args"
  is fine while if it is a means of collecting information use a form in "request.form"

- How do you collect data from a URL placeholder parameter using Flask?
  request.args

- How do you collect data from the query string using Flask?
  request.args.get

- How do you collect data from the body of the request using Flask?
  reuest.form
